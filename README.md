- 👋 Hi, I’m @CarlyBurf
- 👀 I’m interested in tech, music and watching documentaries, spending time with my wonderful children and trying to enjoy life around a hectic schedule
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to programme/code and am also a Student about to begin a Masters in CS with AI, I have been a Qualified Nurse for almost 10 years too, but Healthcare is no longer what it was.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any learning events especially those in the UK and would welcome any tips or hints. I hope to build my own webpage in the next few weeks, so please keep an eye out for that. It will be the most basic page to begin.
